## What is **[Flask](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/flask/)**

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Classified as a microframework, Flask is written in Python and it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Compared to his older brother Flask, Flask provides a lightweight codebase and more freedom to the developer. This might be a good thing because you have more freedom in terms of app design and structure but in the same time, this freedom might inject problems when your application becomes complex.

> Install Flask - via PIP (the standard package manager for Python)

```bash
$ pip install Flask
```
